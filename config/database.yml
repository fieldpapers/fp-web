# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#

# This "production" environment is specialised for deployment on
# Amazon Web Services using the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service, with
# resources set up by the aws-quick-start.py script in the
# fieldpapers/fieldpapers repository.  The RDS_* environment variables
# used here are provided with values by the AWS environment on the EC2
# instance where the web app runs, i.e. they are not explicitly
# assigned values anywhere the web app code, but are set up
# automatically by AWS.
# If DATABASE_URL is provided, that will also work

production:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: <%= ENV['RDS_DB_NAME'] %>
  username: <%= ENV['RDS_USERNAME'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['RDS_PASSWORD'] %>
  host: <%= ENV['RDS_HOSTNAME'] %>
  port: <%= ENV['RDS_PORT'] || 3306 %>
